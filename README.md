# Compiler
### Star if you like! Thx!

### Scanner
* Use the Lex tool to complete scanner.

### Parser
* Use the Yacc tool to complete parser.
* Cooperate with scanner.

### Code Generator
* Extend the code in parser to generate Java assembly code.

### Only need to program the .l (for scanner) and .y (parser and code generator) files, the others are auto generated files.

### The three black boxes in the below image are the parts I implemented.
